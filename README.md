= Credits =
Well, I had to configure wordpress theme and could not find any free plugin to show child pages/posts with thumbnails.
theres are a few free short-code plugins but a shotcode is somehow old way to edit page content.
So i had to make this plugin (with all the sadness, becouse it took some reasonable amount of time to understand the framework and implement it just to allow this basic functionality)

i hope it will help some one,
